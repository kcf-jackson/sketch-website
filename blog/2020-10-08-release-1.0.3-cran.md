We are very happy to introduce the R package sketch for creating animated and interactive visualisation in R! Sketch lets users develop JavaScript-style visualisations using the R syntax by transpiling R code into JavaScript code. It is designed to help

- researchers create domain specific visualisation to support development and sharing of research,
- journalists and science communicators publish high-quality and engaging interactive graphics,
- business users make customised in-house dashboards and reports, and
- general users learn generative arts and interactive data visualisation.

Sketch works with any JavaScript library (including d3, p5, vegalite, threejs and leaflet), integrates with R Markdown document and Shiny for easy deployment, and supports a wide range of customisation options.

We are grateful that this project is supported by the [R Consortium ISC grant](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/awarded-projects/2020-group-1#Interactive+visualisations+in+R+via+R-to-JavaScript-transpilation), and sketch is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sketch) (stable version) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/kcf-jackson/sketch) (development version).
