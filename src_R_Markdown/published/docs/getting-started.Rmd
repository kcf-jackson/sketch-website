## Overview

`sketch` is an R package for creating animated and interactive visualisations. It lets users develop JavaScript-style visualisations using the R syntax, and it is designed to help

- researchers create domain specific visualisation to support development and sharing of research,
- journalists and science communicators publish high-quality and engaging interactive graphics,
- business users make customised in-house reports, and
- general users learn generative arts and interactive data visualisation.

In the core, the package is a transpiler which converts R code into JavaScript code. It does so by rewriting an R parse tree into a JavaScript one. Here is an illustration.

### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("sketch")

# For the development version
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kcf-jackson/sketch", "develop")
```

### Running a sketch R file

There are two ways to run a sketch R file.

1. Save the sketch R file (with the usual .R extension), then call `sketch::source_r` with it.

2. If you use RStudio, there is an add-in “source a sketch R file” listed under this package (consider binding that to the key combination alt-shift-s), and that sources the active tab in the editor. Alternatively, you can call the `source_active()` function.

## First example with sketch

(In the following example, please use `source_r` with the option `deparsers = default_2_deparsers()`.)

As the first example with **sketch**, we will use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to make this animated visualisation:

```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
sketch::insert_sketch("getting_started.R", 
                      asset_tags = default_tags(local = FALSE),
                      style = NULL,
                      class = "border-none width-420 height-330")
```

- An important aspect of this package is that “Apps” produced by sketch run in the browser natively without an R back-end. The App is live, and it supports interactivity.

- In fact, you can write sketch code directly in R Markdown documents, generate an HTML file, and share it online easily (just like this page you are reading right now!).

- p5.js is chosen here because it has an user-friendly API and many good learning resources online.



### i. Basic structure

The structure of a p5 application looks like this:

#### main.R

```{sketch, eval = TRUE, asset_tags = default_tags(local = FALSE), class="border-none width-420 height-330", style = NULL, deparsers = default_2_deparsers()}
#! load_library("p5")

setup <- function() {       
    createCanvas(400, 300)  # create a canvas of size 400 x 300 (w x h)
}

draw <- function() {        
    background(0, 0, 33)    # paint the background with the RGB colour
    fill("red")             # change fill colour to "red"
    circle(200, 150, 50)    # draw a circle (x, y, diameter)
}
```

- `#! load_library` is used to load the p5 library. Despite being commented out, lines starting with `#!` are actually processed by the **sketch** package.

- p5.js looks for functions named (specifically) `setup` and `draw`, and it runs

    - `setup` once at the start of the App, and
    - `draw` iteratively 60 times per second after the App starts.
        
- `createCanvas`, `background`, `fill` and `circle` are functions provided by p5.js for drawing on the screen.




### ii. Add more circles

Let's create a `person` object, and draw 50 of them on the screen. We need an `id` to identify the person and its coordinates `x` and `y` at which a circle will be drawn.

```{sketch, eval = TRUE, asset_tags = default_tags(local = FALSE), class="border-none width-420 height-330", style = NULL, deparsers = default_2_deparsers()}
#! load_library("p5")

# Make a "person" object
person <- function(id) {
    list(id = id, x = runif(1, 0, 400), y = runif(1, 0, 300))
}

# Set up variables
radius <- 5
people <- map(1:50, person)

setup <- function() {
    createCanvas(400, 300)  
}

draw <- function() {
    background(0, 0, 33)    
    for (person in people) {   # Use a for loop to draw one person at a time
        fill(190, 128, 0)                
        circle(person$x, person$y, 2*radius)   
    }
    NULL
}
```


### iii. Add movements

To make the people move, we add two velocity states `vx` and `vy` to the “person” object and a function that changes a person’s position based on its velocity.

An important point to notice is that JavaScript* passes object by reference, so when you pass an object to a function and make changes to it, the changes applies to the object directly and no copying occurs. To clarify this point, the super-assign symbol `<<-` is used below to indicate where one should expect object modification.

(*Did you notice you have been writing JavaScript?)

```{sketch, eval = TRUE, asset_tags = default_tags(local = FALSE), class = "border-none width-420 height-330", style = NULL, deparsers = default_2_deparsers()}
#! load_library("p5")

# Make a "person" object
person <- function(id) {
    list(id = id, x = runif(1, 0, 400), y = runif(1, 0, 300),
         vx = runif(1, -2, 2), vy = runif(1, -2, 2))  # Add velocity
}

move <- function(person) {
    new_x <- person$x + person$vx     # Update position
    new_y <- person$y + person$vy
    
    # If the new position is out of the screen, the person should turn back!
    # Otherwise, move to the new position
    if (new_x < 0 || new_x > 400) { 
        person$vx <<- person$vx * -1  # Turn back!
    } else {
        person$x <<- new_x            # Move to the new position
    }
    
    # Do the same for y
    if (new_y < 0 || new_y > 300) { 
        person$vy <<- person$vy * -1  # Turn back!
    } else {
        person$y <<- new_y            # Move to the new position
    }
    NULL
}

# Set up variables
radius <- 5
people <- map(1:50, person)

setup <- function() {
    createCanvas(400, 300)  
}

draw <- function() {
    background(0, 0, 33)    
    for (person in people) {
        fill(190, 128, 0)                
        circle(person$x, person$y, 2*radius)
        move(person)                  # Call `move` here
    }
    NULL
}
```


### Summary

We have learnt that

- `#! load_library("p5")` is used to load the [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) library,
- `setup` and `draw` form the basic structure of a p5 canvas,
- `background`, `fill` and `circle` are drawing functions from p5.js, and
- JavaScript passes object by reference.



## Next step

That’s it! You have successfully created a JavaScript visualisation without actually writing any JavaScript! I hope you find the examples easy to follow and are convinced that using JavaScript - even to a great extent - does not need to be hard. Leveraging the existing JavaScript libraries, **sketch** opens up many new possibilities with visualisations. For the next step,

- see [Showcase](/showcase/) for some use cases,

- see [Tutorial](/tutorial/) to explore other visualisations - this is the main avenue to learn how to use the package, 

- see [API](/api/) for full API documentation, or

- continue to the next section to learn more about the details of the package (it is recommeded to visit this after one has followed through a couple of the tutorials).
